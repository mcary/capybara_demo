h1. Capybara Demo

This project is a demo of Capybara with Selenium to be used for
automated browser testing with RSpec.  Capybara::Screenshot and
spork are also present.

h2. Rationale

This setup started out as a Rails app, but now has those parts
removed on the assuption that this will be used primarily for
testing non-Rails apps.  As a result, all the support for
fixtures and direct database access is removed.

h2. Setup

Assuming you have Ruby, Rubygems, and bundler installed:

 git clone https://github.com/mcary/capybara_demo.git
 cd capybara_demo/
 bundle install

You'll also need Firefox installed to run the browser tests.

To run specs:

 bundle exec rspec spec/

h2. Reference Docs

For more on how to write specs with Capybara, check out the
Capybara DSL:

* https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara#the-dsl
* http://rubydoc.info/github/jnicklas/capybara/master

And for writing specs in general, check out RSpec docs.  (But
note that much of RSpec targets writing unit tests rather than
browser-level integration tests.)

h2. Next Steps

Figure out how to run selected tests in IE and/or Chrome.
